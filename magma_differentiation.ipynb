    "This is meant as a virtual alternative to using jelly beans or bingo chips for the magma differentiation lab. In the lab, you start with a set number of cations (chips/jelly beans) in a magma chamber drawn on paper, and you systematically remove them as you crystallize minerals during fractionation. This notebook simulates this by showing colored bar charts to represent the cations in the magma chamber and the cations that have been taken up in crystallized minerals.\n",
