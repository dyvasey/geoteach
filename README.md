## About

Short coding projects designed to assist teaching in geology and the Earth sciences. Currently focused on structural geology and igneous petrology. Jupyter notebooks for each of these topics are available in their respective directories. Designed as supplements for lab courses at UC Davis.

You can use these notebooks either by installing the environment.yml file into your own conda environment or by clicking the "launch binder" badge to open them in your own web browser.

### List of Current Topics ###

#### Structural Geology ####

* 3 point problems - not the classic problem per se, but similar types of calculations using intersection of geology and topography
* Plate tectonics - Using Euler poles and angular velocities to describe motions along a sphere

#### Igneous Petrology ####

* Magma differentiation - Simulating differentiation of major elements during fractional crystallization of a magma chamber. Basically a virtual version of the classic M&M/Jelly Beans lab.
* Trace elements - Plotting trace element concentrations during batch melting for different partition coefficients. May be expanded to include fractional crystallization and/or application to real data.
* Total akali-silica plotter - Simple script to plot individual data points on a fully-labeled TAS diagram after Le Bas et al. (1986)
